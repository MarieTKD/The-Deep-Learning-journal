            "content": ". . Getting ready for the Deep Learning for Coders course . This past week, I started my Machine Learning journey, and more specifically, my Deep Learning journey. I started by watching the 3Blue 1Brown videos about Neural Networks which I found to be a very good introduction to Deep Learning. Then I remembered finding, about a year ago, the Fast.ai website. I went to revisit the website and found the course Deep Learning for Coders (part 1 and 2). Intrigued, I looked at the course introduction, and the learning method seemed interesting: a top to bottom approach, meaning that you start by training models and learn as you go. You don’t have to follow math courses for 2 years before starting. You only need a basic knowledge of coding (Python preferably). . I’m game! 🙂 . This doesn’t mean that there is no math. It doesn&#39;t mean that the coding is basic. It doesn’t mean that it will be easy. But it will be more applied than other courses. Here is what I learned from lesson 0, which explains how to use the course, and from visiting the website. . How to finish the course . It might seem like a weird advice. Why start a course about something you want to learn if you don’t plan to finish it. But the subject is challenging, and many people just drop out of it. . It is recommended to make yourself accountable by telling people about taking the course and about your projects. | Have a plan: when will you watch the lectures? Do the assignments? | Join the forum so you have a community helping you when you’re stuck. | If you need more coding knowledge, consider watching the CS50 and the Missing Semester videos on YouTube. | It will take tenacity: you may meet some obstacles, you may have to stop for a while, but make sure to come back as soon as possible. | . How to do well in the course . This is a very challenging course. One lecture may take more than one week. Remember that your ultimate goal isn&#39;t to finish the course in record time, it&#39;s to get as much knowledge as you can from it! . Watch the lecture and/or read the corresponding chapter of the book. . Note: You can read the book for free as a Jupiter Notebook here or buy it here. | Run the Jupiter notebook and play with it (the course explains the different platforms you can use to run the notebooks including free ones). Experiment with the code: try to change values or the order of the lines, for example. | Then reproduce the code on a new notebook, from scratch. . Note: You may have to go through these three steps more than once. | Repeat with a different set of data. | Ask questions. You may think that your question is stupid, but it will surely be useful to many people including you, of course. | Start a great project and publish it! Now, it doesn’t have to save the world to be great. It can be something pretty small. Or something more important. Your choice. | Connect with others . I&#39;ve already talked about the Fast.ai forum which I believe is an amazing tool. Being part of a community, especialy when studying something as challenging as Machine Learning, is vital. Here is a list of other places and ideas to meet fellow data scientists, stay motivated, learn and have fun: . Twitter, of course. Tech Twitter is my favorite place! There&#39;s a lot of great people wanting to connect and help. You can find me there as MarieTKD. | Kaggle: It is highly recommended to participate in the competitions, even though you will do terrible at first. 😆 You can make a team and work your way up the leadership. Kaggle also has a forum where you can ask questions and network. Reading posts from top Kagglers will help a lot. | Blogging, start a podcast, make videos, go live on Twitch... Teaching what you just learned will not only help others understand the concepts, but it will help you having a deeper understanding as well. Teaching is the best way to learn. It&#39;s also important when job hunting. Companies are looking to hire people with good communication skills! If you&#39;re not convinced, I recommend this article by Rachel Thomas, co-founder of Fast.ai. | . I truly hope this article will motivate you to start your own journey. . I also truly hope mine will go well. 😟 The only way to know, is to start! Will you join me? . Note: I used Google Colab to write this article. It was quite fun to do 🙂 .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

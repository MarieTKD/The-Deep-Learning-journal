#Journal day 3

Today I tried to work on my spider classifier but realized that the data collected on the internet wouldn't work: a lot of them are mislabeled.
I might still do this classifier later by using a Kaggle dataset. In the meantime, I will change categories. I've thought about clouds,
crocodile/aligator (but I would have the same problem). I looked briefly into healthy food, legume/vegetable... Hamster/Guinea pig would work well
but it's not very interesting. I'll think about something else.

In my other courses, I learned about map, lambda and list comprehension in Python. I need to work more on it.

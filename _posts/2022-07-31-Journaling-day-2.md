Today I started a new DL project: a spider classifier. I'm using lesson 2 from Fast.ai and my previous notebook "Is it a hedgehog?".
The goal is to put this model to production using Gradio. You will be able to download a picture of spider and it will give the probability
that it's a black widow. I plan to include 4 other types of spiders ressembling the black widow spider. I will select the photos using the scientific name
of these spiders, to avoid too many mislabeled pictures.

I also started 2 new courses: Introduction to data science in Python (Coursera) and Supervised machine learning : regression and classification (Coursera as well).
Lots of work but it's worth it!

# My diary - Week 2 - Fast.ai lesson 2


## Monday August 1 2022

Today I tried to work on my spider classifier but realized that the data collected on the internet wouldn't work: a lot of them are mislabeled.
I might still do this classifier later by using a Kaggle dataset. In the meantime, I will change categories. I've thought about clouds,
crocodile/aligator (but I would have the same problem). I looked briefly into healthy food, legume/vegetable... Hamster/Guinea pig would work well
but it's not very interesting. I'll think about something else.

In my other courses, I learned about map, lambda and list comprehension in Python. I need to work more on it.

I'm thinking about a new classifier to make. My idea for now is a model that would recognize different types of cartoon drawing style: Disney, Marvel, Ghibli.
This would allow people to download their drawings and see what they are closest to. Maybe a 4th more realistic category could be nice. Maybe I could go
with famous painters' styles like Picasso, Van Gogh... This app could be fun. But I think I'll stick with the cartoonish style.

In ML, I learned about linear regression and the cost function. I loved the representation of the cost function in different ways:
